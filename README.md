# The Receipt

A personal, low-friction "memory-capture" app that treats your daily life like a digital paper trail.

## Concept

Instead of random notifications, you "close the tab" on your day at a set time by uploading a single "proof of life"—a photo, a song, a screenshot, or just a few words. These entries are archived into a continuous, scrollable "receipt roll" with automated weekly recaps.

## Getting Started

1. Open `TheReceipt.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device/simulator
3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Requirements

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 17+
- Swift 5.9+
